Play online with other PS4 players with PlayStation Plus.*** Extraordinary entertainment - With up to 4K streaming and 4K auto-upscaling for video content.*** The Assassin's Creed series has taken a year off since the release of Syndicate in 2015, and that additional time has given the team at Ubisoft Montreal a chance to realize its bold vision for the franchise. The Black Flag team pushed the series in new directions with its pirate-flavored entry, and their \"nothing is sacred\" approach is even more evident in Origins. Combat has been reimagined, navigation is tweaked, and foundational elements like Eagle Vision are taking on surprising new forms. We visited Montreal to get hands-on time with the game and talk to its creators, and our cover story packs in plenty of exclusive details within its 14 pages.The game is set in ancient Egypt, which the team says has consistently been requested by fans. You take on the role of Bayek, a warden who will form the Brotherhood of Assassins. Thanks to a deeper focus on RPG and loot systems, you can shape the character in unprecedented ways. If you want to remain hidden and strike when it's safe, you can do that. Or you can focus on melee attacks and come in swinging. Regardless of your playstyle, you are accompanied by your faithful eagle companion, Senu, who you can guide to get a better sense of your surroundings.INCLUDES:* PlayStation 4 Pro 1TB Console, Dualshock 4 Controller, Premium HDMI Cable, Power Adapter, USB Cable, Mono Headset* Assassins Creed: Origins Game* Accessories Kit - Kit Includes:Dual Dock Charging Cradle2 In 1 Micro USB CableMini USB CableBlack Silicone Sleeve for Controller4 Controller Thumb GripsCleaning Cloth",
